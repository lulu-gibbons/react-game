# Brewery Clicky Game
### A React Memory Game

## How To Play

Just start the game by clicking on any of the brewery logos. Click each brewery logo ONLY ONCE. If a logo is click twice, the game will end.

Earn points by clicking on a different logo and try to get a higher score with each new round.

## Current issues being worked on:

This React app is deployed using Github pages but it will timeout and stop working after awhile. Then I have to manually switch between
the master branch and gh-pages branch to get it to show up again. I've included a video below to show that the app works at the Github
pages URL just in case it is down when trying to be viewed.
